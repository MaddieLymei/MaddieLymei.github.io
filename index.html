                <p>Madeleine absolutely loves animals. She went vegeterian for about 2 years, and owns four cats and one dog. All her animals are adopted, and she constantly has animals 
                    in foster care. To see if there are any animals available for adoption in her foster care, check out the <a href="Gallery.html">gallery!</a>

                <p>One of Madeleine's goals this year is to try see and experience as much of nature as Africa has to offer. She really got into hiking when she lived in 
                    England in 2021. She is looking to conquer KZN, Western Cape, Gauteng and Limpopo's top hiking trails by the end of the year. One hike she is hoping to complete 
                    is Rota Vicentina, in Portugal.

                    <br>
                    Madeleine is almost done with her honours degree in Software Engineering. Her research topic was titled "The use of computer visioning in Plastic Recycling, South Africa", 
                    she has done her BComp and honours through <a href="https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/">Belgium Campus.</a> She hopes to complete her masters in drone technology, implementing
                    Artificial Intelligence to reduce deforestation and human rights violations in the Congo.
